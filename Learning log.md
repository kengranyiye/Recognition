# Learning log  
### 2017.5.6  
We decide to use python to build the project. It will be based on neural networks and deep learning.  
OPENCV is efficient, but it may a little bit out of date. The recent recognition methods are mentioned above.  
To start our learning, we choose 'Deep Learning' as reference book, and use frame tensorflow and keras to practice.
